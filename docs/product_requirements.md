## 8. Appendix

### 8.1 API Specification
- `POST /api/chat`
  - Request Body:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Your message here",
      "model": "smollm2:135m",
      "stream": false
    }
    ```
  - Response:
    ```json
    {
      "response": "AI response here",
      "model": "smollm2:135m"
    }
    ```

- `GET /api/models`
  - Response:
    ```json
    {
      "models": [
        {"name": "smollm2:135m"},
        {"name": "llama2"},
        {"name": "mistral"}
      ]
    }
    ```

- [TODO] `POST /api/models/pull`
  - Request Body:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "model-name"
    }
    ```
  - Response:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Model pulled successfully"
    }
    ```

### 8.2 Deployment Architecture
The application consists of two main components:
1. Ollama server container - Provides the LLM API and manages models
2. Chatbox container - Provides the web UI and API endpoints

These communicate via HTTP, with the Chatbox server making API calls to the Ollama server.
